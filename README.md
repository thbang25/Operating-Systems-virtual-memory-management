# OS-virtual-memory-management

**Thabang Sambo SMBTHA002**

This algorithm reads a binary file for virtual memory addresses. 
It then uses a fixed page table to transform each virtual address into a physical address. 
The consequent translated physical addresses are written to a specified output file named output-OS1 and displayed on the console.
